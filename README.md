# Description

push_swap: Create a performant sorting algorithm The goal of the push_swap assignment is to create a program that will sort a stack of numbers using two stacks (a and b) and print the operations used in order to do so. Our goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations. In the case of an error, our code shout print an error on the stderr file descriptor. My project is separated in 3 main parts, the parsing (input handling), the operations and the algorithm. 

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. To compile you must first use the make command in order to get the ./push_swap program. Once you have it, you must enter a stack of numbers. The numbers can be negative, positive, 0, and within the 4 byte integer limit. If the input is not stated as correct, the program will simply print "Error\n".


# Ressources

Ressources : For my project, I read/watched diverse videos and articles, mainly to choose an algorithm that suited me. I used youtube or just plain google searches. I used AI to help me design the parser as I reviewed my pseudo-code with it. It gave me a better idea on how to structure my functions considering the norminette restrictions. I also used it to help me with the core of the Radix algorithm, which was quite difficult at the beggining. After finalizing the project, I asked AI for various inputs to try to make my program leak, or crash. I fixed the errors with a peer.
